The program provides free condoms at unusual outdoor locations. Posters around Fitzroy Crossing advertise "Free Condoms in a Tree Near You." Under the program, canisters of condoms are hung from trees where different Aboriginal language groups traditionally gather. Patrick Davies from the Nindin-lin-gaari Cultural Health Center says the idea follows concern over the high rate of sexually transmitted diseases. He says previously people were embarrassed about getting condoms from the only outlets in town—the hospital or the news agency. "We were able to target the people from outlying communities when they came into town by hanging these PVC containers under those trees—they take about 2,500 or 3,000 every month," he said.', 1365455090, 1365455090, 1),

Symptoms resemble very\r\nmuch those of cyanide poisoning (blue face, etc.).  In higher\r\nconcentrations, e.g. 20%, the toxic effect is somewhat delayed and it\r\ntakes about 2.5 billion inhalations before death takes place.  The reason\r\nfor the delay is the difference in the mechanism of the toxic effect of\r\noxygen in 20% concentration.  It apparently contributes to a complex\r\nprocess called aging, of which very little is known, except that it is\r\nalways fatal.\r\n\r\nHowever, the main disadvantage of the 20% oxygen concentration is in the\r\nfact it is habit forming.

The program provides free condoms at unusual outdoor locations. Posters around Fitzroy Crossing advertise "Free Condoms in a Tree Near You." Under the program, canisters of condoms are hung from trees where different Aboriginal language groups traditionally gather. Patrick Davies from the Nindin-lin-gaari Cultural Health Center says the idea follows concern over the high rate of sexually transmitted diseases. He says previously people were embarrassed about getting condoms from the only outlets in town—the hospital or the news agency. "We were able to target the people from outlying communities when they came into town by hanging these PVC containers under those trees—they take about 2,500 or 3,000 every month," he said.'),

So when you enter into it with your small capacity, of course there is danger. But without facing this danger nobody has ever become integrated, nobody has ever become an individual, indivisible.\n\nZen, or meditation, is the method which will help you to go through the chaos, through the dark night of the soul, balanced, disciplined, alert.
